This file contains informations required to properly build and create installation file
for the OpenVideoHub application.

1. Requirements:
 Following packages are needed to build OpenVideoHub:
 
 - 3rd or 5th edition Symbian S60 SDK. See http://forum.nokia.com/ for more details.
 - Carbide 2.x. See http://forum.nokia.com/ for more details.
 - OpenC SDK Plugin.
   http://www.forum.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/91d89929-fb8c-4d66-bea0-227e42df9053/Open_C_SDK_Plug-In.html
 - DevSound library. It can be found in Nokia MR API plugin pack:
   http://sw.nokia.com/id/53439e01-f605-4491-96f4-62d003bd4c0c/S60_3rd_SDK_MR_API_Plug-In_Pack1.zip
 - RealView compiler (not needed but recommended, since GCC does not produce code optimized enough).
 
2. 3rd and 5th S60 editions.
 Althought most of the code specific for 5th edition is behind ifdefs, there are 2 exceptions:
  - OpenVideoHub_0x2001A7DC.rss file contains code that has to be enabled for 5th edition.
    The '#if 0' statement in lines 507 and 513 should be changed to '#if 1' if the application
    is being compiled for S60 5th edition.
  - In OpenVideoHub.mmp file a reference to a touchfeedback.lib (in line 168) should be disabled if
    application is being compiled for S60 3rd edition.

3. Compiling the libavvideo/libavaudio libraries.
 Before compiling both libraries a small sublibrary containing all the asm optimizations
 should be compiled (this is only required if building for device). Proceed to paragraph
 3.2 if you want to build the libraries for emulator only.

 3.1 Building the libasm library.
  The library mmp file is located in libav/group_asm. In order to compile execute
  following steps from command line:
   
  cd libav
  cd group_asm
  bldmake bldfiles
  abld build gcce urel
   
  This library should be build using GCC compiler.
   
 3.2 Building the libavaudio/libavvideo libraries.
  In order to compile libavaudio/libavvideo for device execute following steps 
  from command line:
 
  cd libav
  cd group
  bldmake bldfiles
  abld build armv5 urel
  
  Both libraries can also be compiled using gcc compiler, but it is recommended to use
  RealView compiler for performance reasons - libraries compiled with gcc compiler
  are much slower.

  If you would like to build the libraries for emulator:
   
  cd libav
  cd group
  bldmake bldfiles
  abld build winscw udeb
   
  It is also possible to import the provided bld.inf file into Carbide and build the project
  from there.
   
4. Compiling the yuvasm library.
 This library is only needed if the OpenVideoHub application is being build for a device.
 The library mmp file is located in OpenVideoHub/yuvasm/. In order to compile execute
 following steps from command line:
   
  cd libav
  cd group_asm
  bldmake bldfiles
  abld build gcce urel

  This library should be build using GCC compiler.

5. Compiling main application.
 5.1. Macros used to configure the main application.
 Some features of the application can be controlled via macros in the mmp file:
  - ENABLE_LOG - Enables logging to a file. All Log() statements in the source code
  will be saved to a file 'emtube.log' in C:\Data\ directory (on a device, on an emulator
  the file is located in epoc32\winscw\c\data\).

  - ENABLE_TRANSFER_MANAGER - enables transfer manager feature. The TM icon is placed on the 
  main menu and it is also possible to add files to TM instead of downloading them 

  - ENABLE_SITE_SELECTION - enables the view with list of sites, where user can enter
  credentials (needed for example for uploading) as well as select default video
  site for searching.

  - ENABLE_FINDBOX_IN_SAVEDCLIPS - enables findbox in saved clips view. User can type
  string to limit numbers of clips shown on the list. There were problems with this
  feature, requires heavy testing before can be enabled for production.

  - ENABLE_CUSTOM_UI - allows user to change look and feel from Symbian UI to custom UI.
  Not finished.
  
  - ENABLE_MORE_ON_PLUGIN_LIST - Adds new entry at the bottom of site list view which allows
  to run browser with a site containing additional plugins in sis packages. Not finished.

  - ENABLE_PLAYLISTS - Enables playlists. User can create and edit playlists, add/remove clips
  (both local and remote) and play all the clips from a playlist one by one. More or less
  finished, requires testing and small bugfixes.

  - ENABLE_CHECK_FOR_UPDATES_MENU_ITEM - Adds "Check for update" menu item. It allows to contact
  the server and in case new version of the software is available automatically starts downloading
  the update.

  - ENABLE_OPEN_BY_ID_MENU_ITEM - Allows to enter an ID of the video. The application should download
  a movie that corrsponds to that ID from the video site. Does not work, since the introduciton of 
  multiple sites. Might still work with youtube, but was not tested.

  - ENABLE_TABS - Allows to search videos on multiple sites at the same time, the sites are placed
  on tabs and user can switch between them using left/right keys (or toolbar buttons on TouchUI).
  Tested and works correctly.

 5.2 Compiling the core app.
  The core app mmp file is located in OpenVideoHub/group/ directory. To compile this program you will first
  need to compile yuvasm library as well as libav audio/video libraries. To compile the app type:
   cd group
   bldmake bldfiles
   abld build armv5 urel
   
   or
   
   abld build winscw udeb
   if oyu want to compile for the emualtor only.
  
6. Compiling plugins:
 Each of the plugins can be compiled separately by entering the plugin directory
 and typing:
  bldmake bldfiles
  abld build armv5 urel
  
  or
  
  abld build winscw udeb
  if you want to compile for the emualtor only.
 Youtube, dailymotion and metacafe plugins are required to build the sis file.

7. Creating sis file:
 Pkg file is provided in the OpenVideoHub/sis file. You will need to compile main application,
 libav audio/video, recognizer as well as youtube/dailymotion and metacafe plugins in order
 to build the sis file. Since the application uses UIDs from protected range the sis has to
 be signed before it can be installed on the phone.

8. TODO list.
 A list of possible improvements and known bugs can be found in TODO.txt file.
