- Replace the UIDs in main application and all plugins
  with UIDs from unprotected range so that the application can be self signed.
  Might require removing recognizer, as it requires heavy capabilities.

- Allow users to define categories in "Saved clips" and move clips around
  categories.

- Add option to start playback from user defined (in seconds) position.

- Add ability to access user videos/favorities/playlists/subscribed channels
  on youtube. Might require adding new functions to the plugins API.

- Fix help and documentation to reflect the changes in scale change settings.

- Enable playlist support, fix any remaining problems and bugs.

- Shuffle playlists using accelerometer and shake.

- Add a code that warns user about transfer manager not being empty when
  exit is being called.

- Support for KCapsVideoDownload flag in gvh app. Do not show that plugin on 
  the list, and on the tabs. Only on the upload dialog.

- Seeking doesn't work with youtube clips. Check the demuxer for possible
  problems with index handling.
  
- Add ability to display more than one thumbnail. When user waits on one entry
  download them and change using timer.

- Use the new OSD (for touch UI) as default. It has to be modified to support
  scaling the interface down.

- Enable FindBox in Saved Clips. Since this code was not tested, heavy
  bugfixing might be required.
